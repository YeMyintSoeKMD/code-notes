## 🧠 What is a Queue?

A **Queue** is a data structure that works on the **FIFO** principle:

> **First In, First Out**

Think of it like a line of people waiting at a bank — the person who comes first gets served first.

---

## ✅ Why Do We Need a Queue?

In Laravel, **queues are used to delay or defer time-consuming tasks** like:

* Sending emails
* Processing uploaded files (e.g., image resizing)
* Sending notifications
* Performing API requests
* Any background task you don’t want to slow down your response time

Without queues, your app has to complete these tasks **before responding** to the user, which can slow down the user experience.

## ⚙️ How Does Queue Work in Laravel?

Laravel uses the **Job Dispatching** system to push jobs into a **queue**. Then a **queue worker** listens and processes these jobs in the background.

Flow:

```
User Action -> Laravel Controller -> Dispatch Job -> Job is queued -> Worker handles Job
```

## 🛠️ Step 1: Setup Laravel Queue Configuration

In `.env`, Laravel supports multiple queue drivers:

```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

Other options include `sync`, `redis`, `sqs`, `beanstalkd`, etc.

By default, it's `sync`, which processes jobs immediately (no delay).

To use `database`, set it in `.env` as above and then run:

```bash
php artisan queue:table
php artisan migrate
```

This creates a `jobs` table to store queued jobs. But later version of laravel come with these out of the box.

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Create a Job

Let’s create a job to send a welcome email to a user:

```bash
php artisan make:job SendWelcomeEmail
```

This creates a file in `app/Jobs/SendWelcomeEmail.php`.

Edit it like this:

```php
namespace App\Jobs;

use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable;

class SendWelcomeEmail implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, Queueable;

    protected $user;

    public function __construct(User $user)
    {
        $this->user = $user;
    }

    public function handle()
    {
        Mail::raw('Welcome to our site!', function ($message) {
            $message->to($this->user->email)
                    ->subject('Welcome!');
        });
    }
}
```

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Dispatch the Job

Now, dispatch this job wherever appropriate (e.g., after user registration):

```php
use App\Jobs\SendWelcomeEmail;

public function register(Request $request)
{
    $user = User::create($request->all());

    // Push the job to queue
    SendWelcomeEmail::dispatch($user);

    return response()->json(['message' => 'User registered!']);
}
```

---

## 🔁 Step 4: Process the Queue (Run Worker)

To process the queued jobs:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

This command starts a **queue worker** which listens for jobs and executes them.

If you're in production, you can use:

```bash
php artisan queue:work --daemon
```

Or use **Supervisor** to keep workers alive (recommended for production).

---

## 📌 Step 5: Optional - Delay Jobs

You can delay execution like this:

```php
SendWelcomeEmail::dispatch($user)->delay(now()->addMinutes(5));
```

---

## 🛑 Step 6: Failed Jobs (Optional)

To store failed jobs:

```bash
php artisan queue:failed-table
php artisan migrate
```

In `.env`:

```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

You can see failed jobs via:

```bash
php artisan queue:failed
```

Retry a failed job:

```bash
php artisan queue:retry <job-id>
```
