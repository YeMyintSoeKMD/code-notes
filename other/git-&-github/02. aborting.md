# The Error
fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.

# The Solution
**1. Fetch the latest:**
``` 
git fetch origin
```

**2. Merge the Remote Changes into Your Local Branch:**
``` 
git merge origin/dev
```
Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur.
After resolving conflicts, do some stuffs as usual:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin dev
```
